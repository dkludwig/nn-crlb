This repository has code I wrote to (at a high level) model the data acquisition and reconstruction processes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In order to speed up MRI scanning times, parallel imaging methods use multiple different scanning coils at the same time to allow for undersampling the k-space data. While the multiple channels of k-space data can be understood as a linear function of the underlying position-space structure, the sensitivity maps of each coil that contribute to this function have a complex dependence on the geometry of the measurement apparatus and are therefore not known independently. Deep learning methods are becoming more common in the effort to accurately invert this unknown linear encoding (e.g. the fastMRI competition)
